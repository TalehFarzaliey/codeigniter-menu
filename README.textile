h1. CodeIgniter Menu

Implementation of a menu navigation tree using database storage.
Provides the necessary library code for CodeIgniter PHP framework.

h2. INSTALLATION

- import the database schema to your own database
- by default the library is structured in a way that assumes you're using the HMVC approach,
specifically, the modular separation plugin so all the directories should go into a module
called 'menu'. If you'd like to simply throw it into the application/ folder then just copy
the files to their respective directories: application/libraries and application/models and
take care to change the model filename from the library constructor.
